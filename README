NAME
    Module::Build::SysPath - Module::Build subclass with Sys::Path used in
    new() and ACTION_install()

SYNOPSIS
        use Module::Build::SysPath;
        my $builder = Module::Build::SysPath->new(
            ...

DESCRIPTION
    A subclass of Module::Build using Sys::Path to determine the system
    folders. Help in task of installing files into system folders and
    keeping the option to work in local distribution files while developing
    the module.

    See Acme::SysPath for example usage of a module that needs a
    configuration and a folder to store templates in.

USAGE
  module-starter

        module-starter --builder=Module::Build --module=Acme::NewModule --author="Pod" --email=pod@pod
        cd Acme-NewModule/
        perl -lane 's/Module::Build-/Module::Build::SysPath-/; print $_;' -i Build.PL 
        vim Build.PL
        # s/Module::Build-/Module::Build::SysPath-/
        # add "configure_requires => { 'Module::Build::SysPath' => 0.10 },"
        # add "Module::Build::SysPath' => 0.10," to build_requires

  create SPc.pm

    copy http://github.com/jozef/Sys-Path/blob/master/examples/SPc.pm and
    add it to your source tree. Clean up the paths that you don't need.
    Local distribution folder names can be changed to anyones taste. For
    example:

        sub sysconfdir { File::Spec->catdir(__PACKAGE__->prefix, 'conf') };

    'conf' is the name of a folder with conffiles. All file put to this
    folder will be installed to Sys::Path->sysconfdir().

  use the SPc.pm

    Calling `Acme::NewModule::SPc->sysconfdir' before the distribution is
    installed will return path to the 'conf' folder in the distribution root
    folder. Calling it after install the distribution will return
    Sys::Path->sysconfdir().

EXAMPLE
    See Acme::SysPath for a really simple, Test::Daily for a real world
    example.

  new

    Populates:

        $builder->{'properties'}->{$path_type.'_files'} = ...;
        $builder->{'properties'}->{'install_path'}->{$path_type} = ...;
        $builder->add_build_element($path_type);

    To install files located in:

            sysconfdir
            datadir
            docdir
            localedir
            webdir

    Files in:

        cachedir
        logdir
        spooldir
        rundir
        lockdir
        sharedstatedir

    are skipped during the instalation. Add .exists to this folders if you
    want them to be created during `./Build install`.

    Configuration files get a special (Debian like) treatment. All files in
    `sysconfdir' and all files specified as
    `$builder->{'properties'}->{'conffiles'}' are configuration files. Using
    Sys::Path the conffiles checksums are tracked. Here are the model
    situations:

    conffile was never installed jet
        The file is just copied in place (to sysconfdir) as it is. MD5 is
        recorded.

    distribution ships new version, no change in system
        The distribution changed the conffile (for example by adding new
        values), but the conffile was untouched in the system. Then the new
        version from distribution replaces the one in the system.

    distribution conffile wasn't changed, conffile changed in system
        Already installed distribution is getting upgrade. Distribution
        conffiles form installed and the new version didn't change. But the
        conffile was changed in the system. No prompt and the conffile is
        kept intact.

    distribution conffile change, conffile changed in system
        Already installed distribution is getting upgrade. When both the
        distribution changed the conffile and the conffile was changed in
        the system. User will be prompted what to do:

            Installing new version of config file /etc/SOMEFILE ...
    
            Configuration file `/etc/SOMEFILE'
             ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
             ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
               What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
                Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
                N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
                  D     : show the differences between the versions
                  Z     : background this process to examine the situation
             The default action is to keep your current version.
    
            *** /etc/SOMEFILE (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) ?

        If N or O is selected distribution files is installed with -spc
        suffix. If Y or I is selected the system conffile is renamed by
        adding suffix -old and distribution conffile is installed.

  ACTION_install

    This action is responsible for renaming files, replacing SPc.pm paths to
    systems once from Sys::Path. Also makes files writeable (chmod 0644).
    And stores the checksums of conffiles.
